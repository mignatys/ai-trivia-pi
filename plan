1)a greeting should be played after players push button to start the game

2)answer was accepted as correct with no team name, LLM will return "" in team name if it was not detected. our code should handle it and request teams to resubmit answer we have a TTS for that
3) after each round output debug with team score
- if the same team answers the first question and then the second it is allowed. alternating answering order rule only takes place within the same round and when the first team that answered the question answered it wrong.
- when the first team gives a wrong answer and we resume the timer, do not repeat the question just resume the timer
- if a team gave a wrong answer and time ran out and we gave a hint, alternating order resets and any team can answer again.
-when question is set to no answer state, this TTS is played twice

we should allow longer mic recording pauses, it cut me of without giving a full answer, allow 2 sec delay of no voice.
