Constraints:
1.  All content (questions, intros, hints) must be in the Target Language ({language}).

5.  Questions must be short (max 2-3 sentences).

    - **Rounds 1-10 (Main Game):** "host_intro" should be a joke, sarcastic remark, or context leading to the question.
    - **Round 11 (Tie-Breaker):** "host_intro" MUST explicitly mention that the scores are tied and this is a "Tie-Breaker" round.
    - **Round 12 (Sudden Death):** "host_intro" MUST explicitly mention "Sudden Death" or "Final Chance" to determine the winner because the tie persists.
